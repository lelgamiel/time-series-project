# time-series-project

(R) A time series project looking at mean housing costs in the city of London from years 1995-2020, using time series techniques such as transformation, differencing, model selection using ACF and PACFs, AICC comparison, residual diagnostic checking, forecasting, and more. My goal was to determine whether or not mean housing costs in London would continue to steadily increase as they have been for the last 25 years. Results confirmed that London housing prices can be successfully modeled and forecasted by a SARIMA, or Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model.
